                <p>What's up, my name is Cade Holtry and I am from California. I am currently serving a mission for the 
                    Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. I enjoy programming, art, and board games. Because I am
                    serving a service mission, I get to do some college class while on my mission! My mission has been 
                    going great so far, and I can't wait to continue with college afterwards. Pictured to the right is me
                    and my (gorgeous) girlfriend in front of the Oakland temple. Hopefully I can take her there after my
                    mission ;P. Speaking of temples, I am actually a temple ordinance worker, and it's great! If you'd 
                    like to see a list of my favorite temples, see below.</p>

                <p>California is one of the west most states in the US, home to many beaches, sights, and rap legends. If you're coming from the east, you'll know you've hit Cali when the desert ends and the beauty begins!</p>
